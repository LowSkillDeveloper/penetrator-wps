# penetrator-wps

This is experimental tool that is capable of attacking multiple WPS-enabled wireless access points in real time.<br>
It utilizes the pixie-dust attack every time it receives M3 message, unless it is disabled with -P<br>
pixie-dust requires <a href="https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps">pixiewps</a> to be installed.<br>

#installation

First, you need packages libpcap-dev and libssl-dev, install them with apt-get or whatever your distro uses.<br>
If you want the pixie-dust attack to work, you have to install <a href="https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps">pixiewps</a> too.<br>
Then, just run ./install.sh and run 'penetrator'

# attack modes/examples

<b>1. Adding targets manually</b><<br>
This command will attack two APs on channel 1 at the same time, one has BSSID 11:22:33:44:55:66 and second has ESSID "example" and BSSID66:55:44:33:22:11<br>
<b>penetrator -i mon0 -c 1 -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -e example -b 66:55:44:33:22:11</b><br><br>
<b>2. Attacking entire channel</b><br>
This will scan for APs on channel 1 and attack them all at the same time<br>
<b>penetrator -i mon0 -c 1</b><br><br>
<b>3. Attacking all APs in range with pixiewps</b><br>
This will scan all specified channels (or range 1-13 if nothing is specified) and will try pixie-dust attack on all of them.<br>
There is a timeout of 1 minute for every channel, so if it fails to capture M3 message from some APs, it will just skip them.<br>
By default, all APs on the same channel will be attacked at the same time, this can be disabled with <b>-M</b><br>
<b>penetrator -i mon0 -A</b>
